NOTE: This is not structured like a normal blog, instead like a problem solving session. It may not be as easy to read, but I still think it is useful.

I struggle to enjoy serialized stories. This is because of their "watering down" of what I find so interesting in shorter stories. That is to say, structure. Short stories often struggle in structure because there is just not enough to (without great turmoil) structure something interestingly. In expansive serialization, however, it is so large that it is too big for formation (outside of interweaved arcs) to be developed by the writer — and even if it could, it is not realistic for the viewer to grasp it in the same way that would be done in a piece with a more limited scope.

That's not to say this more homogenized structure is *bad*, just that it is antithetical to what I enjoy. I find structure to be one of the areas I find the most joy in my media, and one of the reasons I've become disillusioned with interactive media in the past years. Yes, there have been exceptions — *Breath of the Wild*, for example — but they are far and few between. 

Part of the reason for this, I suspect, is that we just don't have a good framework for thinking about this structure.

Now, I've alleviated this for my studio in some respects, but that's not what this particular article is about. Instead, it is about a particular strand of struggle that I have found both in the development of *Everything I Know, and Everything I'm Ever Gonna Know* as well as the product I am currently in pre-production for. That is, non-linearity in Modern Visual Novels.

Instead of solve it only for this next project, wouldn't it be beneficial to talk about here and solve it on a more philisophical level?

It is not an anomaly in myself as a creator that I wish to create stories that take advantage of the medium. I need the story and the interactivity to be clearly intended in their entertwining. This, however, brings me to the problem I am currently facing. Here are the facts:
1. If something is non-linear, that means that there is content that may be missed.
2. A clean story has no superfluous elements.

Do you see the problem? Quite the conflict between these facts. It would be worth noting that I do, in fact, wish to write clean stories. Usually interactive media creators decide between one or the other, non-linearity or cleanliness, but I want both.

In order to figure out a logical solution to allow for both, I believe the best first tactic is to start to understand each statement a little better. Statement 1 seems to have very little give. The only space I see some possibility for movement is in what we mean by "missed". This, of course, means that it may be "missed" on the first readthrough. It is, of course, possible to not "miss" anything through multiple readthroughs, but this is perhaps a heavy ask.

Statement 2 has some flexibility for non-surface level interpretation. "Superfluous" does not mean that a story does not feel "complete" if an element is removed. It simply means that, with each element, the web of the grander story structure is modified.

To further clarify what I want to avoid, let's talk about the path of least resistence for this. That is, self-contained sub-stories (e.g. sidequests) that act in the same manner as, say, a sitcom. Keep the same characters, change the story. The primary elements of this sub-story, however, are ancillary and unconnected to the grander plot, though minor beats may relate to the progression of the characters involved. In sitcoms, they alleviate this by interweaving the grand plot beats into the sub-story rather than just general character progression. This would be a nice advancement in interactive media, though it would cause the same problems that going the full "no superfluous elements" direction would (the necessity that they are not missed), so we might as well go the full way.

So, what we know from our dissection is that:
1. Even if all content cannot be seen in a single readthrough, multiple readthroughs may occur.
2. Just because a beat missing in a clean story means that the story is fundamentally changed, this does not mean it is not a complete story without the beat.

So, clearly, the solution is to ensure that if optional elements are removed, the story still feels complete, but if they are added in, the story is fundementally changed.¹

So we're solved!?

Well, there's one more element that I want to bring in before we're done. Namely, the completionist desires of consumers of interactive media.

In the current novel that I'm working on, there is a structure similar to the "social links" seen in the *Persona* entries. Well, the way it is setup in those works, it is undavoidable that the user feels the desire to complete the link in order to "close the loop" in their head. It is a predatory tactic that I find harmful to both the art and the consumers.²

In my system, alot of the underlying logic persists, but I don't want the user to feel this intense desire to "close the loop" or see numbers go up. I want them to want to explore and understand the world and characters without that artificial sense of obligation. So how do I do this?

It isn't *what* I am to do, it is what I am *not* to do. I simply do not want to show this information. Leave it obscured. Be ok with bizarre rules for how paths are found. If a user does not know a path exists, they will not be bothered by not completing it. Therefore, we will not use this artificial "close the loop" design.

This raises another question. Do I, then, want save states? Or should I require that the user always start from the beginning and accept what is given to them? If I'm being honest, I think it is the latter. I built a whole system for more complex save slots, but now I'm becoming convinced that the other structure allows for more interesting ideas. This implies that "completion" is not the point, and that if you finished the novel, you got "the experience" that I, as the author, wanted to give you. It implies a constant stream forward...

Yes, obviously if I present things as choices, the user will want to go back and see every branch. However, if I *do not* present the choices, and instead let the events wash over the user and have them make decisions without even realizing that they are making decisions, then the "FOMO" effect should be alleviated.

So thus another question is raised: If the user does not know that they are making decisions, why even include them? All the various paths become expensive. Wouldn't it make sense to just have one path and put all your resources into it?

I'll answer this in two ways, with the first being focused on my desire for low-resistance interactivity. One of the best experiences I've had in interactive media was with *Fear and Hunger: Termina** at the start of which, every move I made seemed to allow me to do what I wanted to do. What's more, the result of said interactions were utterly interesting. It felt like time just moved forward, regardless of what I chose. Not just systemically, as in many open worlds, but the actual story. This is the feeling I want to evoke. Not the feeling of complexity of choice, but instead low resistence branching progression. It just happens. You just do things, and the story progresses accordingly. There is a flow, and you influence it, but you don't necessarily do so with any sort of great intention.

The second way to answer this has to do with re-readability. The first readthrough, the user does not really make any choices, since they don't have the understanding to recognizer where they are making choices. If, however, they choose to readthrough again, they may or may not try different things, but if they do, they'll notice some flexibility in the story. My hope, however, is not for the user to desire to see everything, but simply enjoy the experimentation and flexibility. I have no real desire for true tree-like branching, simply flexibility for the same story.

My desire, which of course will influence the design, is for the user to choose to readthrough again, not in order to see different paths, but instead to re-engage with the story generally, similar to rewatching of a film. In theory, I'd love a tool ancillary to the main program that would allow for a "bookmark" of the mvn, but I wouldn't want this shipped with the products themselves. Instead, this would be for readers who want to learn. This way, the implication would remain that the goal is not to find alternate paths, but an option would still be available for those who want to understand or reread certain sections... Need to continue to think about this. I'd like it for both first AND third party modern visual novels.

¹As a pleasant but unintentional result of this article, another a solution to another long-time problem I've been chewing on has been solved. Namely, "rewarding" users for going down different paths. I've always thought that there needed to be some sort of a clamp at the very end of a novel, but when I look at it this way, with optional elements being directly tied to the main story, this clamping no longer feels necessary.
²To be clear, I don't believe that the *Persona* team has negative intent behind this.
