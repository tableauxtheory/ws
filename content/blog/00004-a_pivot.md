I'm continuing to build a small internet presence. Nothing notable, to most, but enough for me to get a bit of feedback on what works and what doesn't.

And this feedback is huge for me and my sanity. I want (see: "need") to make this a career, so understanding what works for an audience is important. Yes, sticking to truth in what I believe to be "good" is important, and I'm not leaving said area, but it *is* an area that covers alot of space. Therefore, I think it best to pick somewhere within this "good" area that people respond to, and then perhaps, later on, once I have a following that trusts me, lead them on over into more unexplored places within the "good" area.

That's my current philosophy on how to make art and a business at the same time. The problem may directly be posed: I don't know where in this "good" area that people will respond, and the only way to figure this out is to release things. I've been doing this already with my philosophy through these blog posts and YouTube videos.¹

Now, I'm doing this with my art and philosophy, but those are only small elements of the primary products I wish to disperse into the world. That is to say, I'm not receiving a fast enough feedback loop on my modern visual novels!

With this in mind, I intend to cancel the project — the one about the Korean café that I mentioned in a previous blog — and instead work on projects that I can finish in an iteration cycle of roughly three months. It is a bit sad for me to do this, as my favorite format is a scope at which would take about a year to complete, so this is cutting things down to a quarter of that! Obviously, this limits the types of stories I can tell right now, and I believe the structural gold of what modern visual novels can be will be found later, but I also believe this is necessary preparation for both my career and the medium. What I am creating will be the "short story" to the "novel" of modern visual novels. I do not typically, except on rare occasions, love short stories like I do novels, but I will say I've found more and more examples of short stories that I actually do enjoy.

For instance, I prefer Fujimoto's short story anime collection over the "Chainsaw Man" one. I also quite love the short story of Gogol's "The Nose". While I don't love the experience of reading it, "The Handsomest Drowned Man in The World" is a short story that's metaphor has been generally useful in my mental web.²

//TODO: Continue on thoughts about short stories.

//TODO: Wrap things around to discuss what this "pivot", from the title, is.

¹I am, by the by, very uneasy about doing the YouTube video element of this. I wish I could just leave all this to blog posts, but, given what will be seen in the rest of this article, the content has to actually be *seen*, and this just won't happen If I simply post on my personal website. I've tried other text-based blogging sites such as Medium, but there was seemingly no organic traction via their algorithm. If anyone knows how to gain traction, reach out please. For now, it seems my only choice is to read these text-based articles on YouTube to gain response.
²"Mental web", I'm sure, is interpretable by the reader, but by all means I'm just talking about the interconnected ideas that make up my philosophy.
