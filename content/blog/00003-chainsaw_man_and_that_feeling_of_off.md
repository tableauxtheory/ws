Note: This is not a review of *Chainsaw Man*.

I just finished watching the first season of *Chainsaw Man*. I haven't watched a tv show for years. I typically don't love serial television, unless there is a set episode count, but *Chainsaw Man* checked many boxes that I appreciate aesthetically. In particular, having watched the introduction, I noticed the show contained a feel that is typically present in my favorite media, such as *The Master and Margarita*, *Devil Man: Crybaby* and *The Brothers Karamasov*.

See a trend in these media? Whether directly or indirectly they point to the spiritual. Everyone includes a Christian figure showing up, typically the Devil or an equivalent. *Chainsaw Man* also plays with spiritual matters. Yet, I am unconvinced that this direct imagery is what I mean when I say "contained a feel". Other media I've consumed also includes this imagery, but I wouldn't consider them my favorites. Instead, the use of Christian symbolism simply is correlation, rather than causation.

Correlation, in that, use of Christian imagery indicates a proposed mission. Namely, the attempt to "point towards God". If done correctly, we receive what I have, in the past, called a "feeling of off".

In my research and practice, this "feeling of off" is resultant of an extreme use of "peculiar" causing a feeling of "right" more right than regular right. Jerry uses "wrong" in place of "peculiar", but I fear that "wrong" comes with the baggage of a negative moral polarity, which is important to avoid as we progress through this blog.

//TODO: Be sure to get to where *Chainsaw Man* succeeds and fails.

//TODO: Finalize in exploring that this "feeling of off" may actually be one method of acheiving "spiritual stirring", of which we hope to be of God rather than Satan.

//TODO: Be sure to talk about how this "feeling of off" likely has both positive and negative polarity, hence why I used "peculiar" rather than "wrong" earlier.
