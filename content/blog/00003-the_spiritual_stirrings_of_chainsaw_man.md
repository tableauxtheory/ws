Note: This is not a review of *Chainsaw Man*.

I just finished watching the first season of *Chainsaw Man*. I haven't watched a tv show for years. I typically don't love serial television unless there is a set episode count, but *Chainsaw Man* checked many boxes that I appreciate aesthetically. In particular, having watched the introduction, I noticed the show contained a feel that is typically present in my favorite media, such as *The Master and Margarita*, *Devil Man: Crybaby* and *The Brothers Karamasov*.

See a trend in these media? Whether directly or indirectly they point to the spiritual. Everyone includes a Christian figure showing up, usually the Devil. *Chainsaw Man* also plays with spiritual matters. Yet, I am unconvinced that this direct imagery is what I mean when I say "contained a feel". Other media I've consumed also includes this imagery, but I wouldn't consider them my favorites. Instead, the use of Christian symbolism simply is correlation, rather than causation.

Correlation, in that, use of Christian imagery indicates a proposed mission. Namely, the attempt to "point towards the spiritual". If done correctly, we receive what I have, in the past, called a "feeling of off". This feeling of off, I believe, is one avenue to "spiritual stirring".

In my research and practice, this "feeling of off" is resultant of an extreme use of "peculiar" causing a feeling of "right" — more right than regular right. Jerry uses "wrong" in place of "peculiar", but I fear that "wrong" comes with the baggage of a negative moral polarity, which is important to avoid as we progress through this blog.

So why did *Chainsaw Man* catch my eye? It was this feeling of off, largely nailed in the intro theme aswell as the outros, but, unfortunately, not consistently held during the show's actual runtime. It is not fully absent from the show, leaving me overall not regretful to have watched it. Another piece of media that attempts a spiritual stirring via this avenue is a win in my book.

Before we get to the show, let's look at the theme to see what causes this spiritual stirring from the avenue of off-ness. When I use the term "off", I suspect the reader expects one of two things. One, that of weird ethical or sexual distortions shown in the beach shot in which we see a bikini clad woman in an erotic pose and a man on all fours being led by a woman by means of a dog collar. The second is media rule-breaking, best represented in the same shot in which we zoom in on the collar ordeal, showing it at lower resolution. Neither of these is quite what I mean.

That's not to say that they don't play into the effect. Rapid succession of narratively consistent provocative imagery does, perhaps, lower one's guard for a spiritual stirring, but it seems not to produce the correct feeling on its own.

//TODO: Need to continue on to explore what *is* causing this...

Now, earlier I mentioned that I'd rather say that something is so "peculiar" that circles around and becomes right again than something being "wrong", as "wrong" carries with it the baggage of negative polarity. I want to clarify this.

I strongly believe that this peculiarity method of spiritual stirring can point a viewer to Heaven *or* Hell, and therefore it is on the shoulders of the artist to be aware of what they intend. I do not believe it is in the artist's control how the user responds, and I believe that God will use it for His plans regardless, but it *is* in the artist's best interest to be intentional.
