Have you ever held onto a high bar and attempted to create momentum and swing from idle? It is so hard. There *is* a technique to it, but in reality, for most when starting, the best tactic is to flail wildly until you gain momentum by chance.

//TODO: Add an illustration of gaining momentum from a high bar.

This is where I'm at with marketing.

I'm trying so many things, and some of it is working, but most of it is not. This particular article is for me to share and ruminate on my findings up to this point.

What's failed? Reddit, for one. Reddit has been a good tool for art criticism in some ways, in particular understanding how my art will be perceived from different sects of the internet. Good toughening up, if you will. A crucible. It is also may be a good tool for evangelizing the concept of the "modern visual novel".

What it has *not* been good for is gaining new followers or wishlists or etc. I've tested this enough to rule out the use of Reddit as a major marketing tool. I don't think almost any of my wishlists have come from here, though I don't know for sure.

I've also tried posting on X comment threads designed, in theory, to give awareness to indie projects. This, I believe, has had some sort of impact to my wishlist count, but seemingly not nearly enough to warrant the effort and ethical iffiness—that is, I do not find it very becoming of my studio or myself to post in these sorts of ways.

Simply posting trailers on YouTube as a means of gaining traction is also a failed method for the amount of work they take... The first trailer took easily atleast a day of man-hours and has just shy of 250 views since the time of writing this. This is after months.

I've also mass sent out a press kit to 83 influencers who I considered "in my target demographic". This was about a month ago, and I've received zero responses.

This sounds like a lot of gloom... And yet, a few things *have* worked.

For one, Steam generally *does* actively show product. Seemingly to the right audience, as, at the time of writing, the app has 22,524 impressions and 8,357 visits. This is a clickthrough rate of 32.9%! This not only means that steam is showing it to a good number of people, it is also showing it to people who would be interested by the thumbnail. The problem is, my current total wishlists count is 146... Meaning that there is something wrong occurring due to the storepage. I feel in my gut that the problem is not how I'm representing it via the store page, as I believe it is an accurate representation. Instead, I genuinely believe the problem is that *Everything I Know, and Everything I'm Ever Gonna Know* is failing to excite audiences.

Kickstarter has also been a net success. Not directly, but indirectly. 4Gamer.net, a major Japanese gaming news outlet, covered the campaign, giving me additional eyes on the product aswell as legitimacy which can be used at a later time. The campaign itself is almost certainly going to be a failure, but I still consider this a win. Here too, however, we see *Everything I Know, and Everything I'm Ever Gonna Know* failing to capture audiences through its general outward presence. An article was written on a major news site — a *good* article, at that — and yet, only ~50 wishlists were gained. Which, there is likely a reason for this...

Now, let's consider why the product's web presence may not be resonating so that we may pivot in the future. Again, I *do* believe that the web presence is correct for the product, so it is more innate to how much marketing potential *Everything I Know, and Everything I'm Ever Gonna Know* has. So in regards to this, I believe its three main flaws are in translation, visuals and subject matter.

//TODO: Add translation failure notes. //Talk about response from other cultures being better than american.

//TODO: Add visuals failure notes.

As for subject matter: the core of the story revolves around social implications of fornication, which, understandably, is not particularly palettable to most audiences and is a bit hard to pitch. I was never really able to figure out how to market this appropriately... Partly because the revelation of this is a major plot point, and also because... Well, it is a topic that should be handled with care.

Here is what I'd do instead: continue to rely heavily on aesthetics as a means of marketing, but also be considerate of how story scaffolding pairs with said aesthetic. They do not (and perhaps should not) be synonymous in nature, but they should pair more intentionally than was done in *Everything I Know, and Everything I'm Ever Gonna Know*. I felt as though I had a great marketing handicap as I tried to avoid the true nature of the story. Again, this was the right choice for this product, but it would make my marketing life easier if I could use story scaffolding as a beat... Plus, if it is an interesting pairing with the aesthetic, a certain synergy will emerge.
