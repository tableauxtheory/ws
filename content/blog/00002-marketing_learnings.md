Have you ever held onto a high bar and attempted to create momentum and swing from idle? It is so hard. There *is* a technique to it, but in reality, for most when starting, the best tactic is to flail wildly until you gain momentum by chance.

//TODO: Add an illustration of gaining momentum from a high bar.

This is where I'm at with marketing.

I'm trying so many things, and some of it is working, but most of it is not. This particular article is for me to share and ruminate on my findings up to this point.

What's failed? Reddit, for one. Reddit has been a good tool for art criticism in some ways, in particular understanding how my art will be perceived from different sects of the internet. Good toughening up, if you will. A crucible. It is also may be a good tool for evangelizing the concept of the "modern visual novel".

What it has *not* been good for is gaining new followers or wishlists or etc. I've tested this enough to rule out the use of Reddit as a major marketing tool. I don't think almost any of my wishlists have come from here, though I don't know for sure.

I've also tried posting on X comment threads designed, in theory, to give awareness to indie projects. This, I believe, has had some sort of impact to my wishlist count, but seemingly not nearly enough to warrant the effort and ethical iffiness—that is, I do not find it very becoming of my studio or myself to post in these sorts of ways.

//Go on from here... Be sure to hit what *does* work at some point.
