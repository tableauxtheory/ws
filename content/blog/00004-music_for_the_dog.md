It's been a while since I've read a short story, and since I've been on a Tatsuki Fujimoto kick, I watched his shorts and got inspired. So, we'll do that for this week's "blog".

Note that this story is a bit dark.

"Music for the Dog"

El is short for Ellen. But I'm just El, ok?

My Grandmommy died. Don't make fun of me. Everyone calls their grandmothers different things.

If there is a perfect time for someone to die, now was it for Grandmommy. Just like her, really. I'm starting university this fall, and needed a place. Her's was right in the middle of campus, actually. A small attic that served as a house above the bookstore that she owned. No, it wasn't the University's bookstore. Those are very corporate. That's not the kind of thing Grandmommy enjoyed.

When I say "middle", I mean *middle*, by the by and all.

But when I got there, just me, in the old Volkswagon Beetle she used to own, all of my stuff either in the trunk or tied to the top, I started to think of her not just as a person, but as a dead person. Hmmm... What does that mean?


//TODO: Write out actual content for this outline.
1. Have El explain herself. Who she is should come out through this.
2. Have El complain about her baby sister and how she won't grow up. Hasn't had to deal with troubles that "make a woman a woman".
3. Have El enter into the attic (floor 3), find a music box that is NOT playing and a living puppy, and (unexplicably) decide to just leave both.
4. El should begin discuss "Eye", a boy she's friends with and wishes to be in a relationship with. He is called "Eye" because he wears an eyepatch. 
5. Talk about a class that El and Eye share together.
6. They talk about El's "Grandmommy", and the battle she went through to keep her store on campus... (Unwanted... "Sexual"... Deals.)
7. Time warp to the next semester, in which Eye tries to convince El to let him move in. It is expressed that they don't have a relationship label, so this is an interesting proposition. 
8. Learn that El's sister may have to come stay with her because their parents are both ill.
9. Talk about the assault that "Eye" had committed to El.
10. El returns to the attic. The dog is dissappeared. She plays the music box. The dog, now grown but nearly dead, stammers into view to El and begins being afffectionate to her. It dies as the song ends.
11. She calls "Eye" and says that he can move in.
