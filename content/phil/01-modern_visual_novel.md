These are the criteria for a piece of interactive fiction to be considered a "modern visual novel".

#1: Reading of text is the primary user action.

#2: Obstacles may branch branch but never halt or reverse the user's progress.

#3: Rules 1 and 2 may, in exceptional cases, be broken if doing so provides clear narrative intent.
